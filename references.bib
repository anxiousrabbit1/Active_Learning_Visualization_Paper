booktitle="SIGIR '94",

pages="3--12",
abstract="The ability to cheaply train text classifiers is critical to their use in information retrieval, content analysis, natural language processing, and other tasks involving data which is partly or fully textual. An algorithm for sequential sampling during machine learning of statistical classifiers was developed and tested on a newswire text categorization task. This method, which we call uncertainty sampling, reduced by as much as 500-fold the amount of training data that would have to be manually classified to achieve a given level of effectiveness.",

author = {Dongrui Wu and Chin-Teng Lin and Jian Huang},
keywords = {Active learning, Regression, Greedy sampling, Driver drowsiness estimation},
abstract = {Regression problems are pervasive in real-world applications. Generally a substantial amount of labeled samples are needed to build a regression model with good generalization ability. However, many times it is relatively easy to collect a large number of unlabeled samples, but time-consuming or expensive to label them. Active learning for regression (ALR) is a methodology to reduce the number of labeled samples, by selecting the most beneficial ones to label, instead of random selection. This paper proposes two new ALR approaches based on greedy sampling (GS). The first approach (GSy) selects new samples to increase the diversity in the output space, and the second (iGS) selects new samples to increase the diversity in both input and output spaces. Extensive experiments on 10 UCI and CMU StatLib datasets from various domains, and on 15 subjects on EEG-based driver drowsiness estimation, verified their effectiveness and robustness.}
